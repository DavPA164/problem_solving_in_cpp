    "\n",
    "A linear transformation is completely determined by its action on the basis vectors. If we know $Tv_1, Tv_2,\\ldots,Tv_n$ it is enough to completely determine $T$. \n",

In the matrix above, the $j$th column of $[T]_{B_V}^{B_W}$ consists of scalars needed to write $Tv_j$ as a linear combination of the $w$'s. Thus, the picture showed reminds you that $Tv_j$ is restricted by multiplying each entry in the $j$th column, by the corresponding $w$ from the right and then adding up the resulting vectors.\n",

    "3) The matrix of the linear transformation $T$, with respect to the bases $B_V$ and $B_W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[T]_{B_V}^{B_W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How are these matrices related? We will derive a relationship between these three matrices. And if you look at that relationship it will tell you, why the statement, \"any linear transformation between finite dimensional vector spaces is like multiplying the vector $x$ by the matrix $A$\".\n",
